dotfiles
========

these are my dotfiles, and also a way to manage them. You should fork it. It's nice to have your dotfiles wherever you go. Don't you think?

## requirements
- curl (if you want to use quick install)
- git (your dotfiles are managed in a git repo)
- node (the command line utility is powered by node)

## quick install (requires curl)
> curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sean9999/dotfiles/master/install.sh | bash

## non quick install
